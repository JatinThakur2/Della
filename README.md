# Della
Della allows the user to navigate through four labeled screens named:
- Console
- Action Items
- Members
- Teams

The application also provides four Navigation buttons that take you from one screen to another as well as a Quit button that allows the user to exit the entire application. In addition to the navigation and the “Quit” buttons, the Action Items screen (see Figure 00.2,
below) provides fields that supplies the Della user. 

**The following Action Item information:**
- Name
- Description
- Resolution
- Due date
- Open/close status

Furthermore, a creation date is displayed and for this assignment alone, it is set to the current date whenever the “Update” button is pressed. (For future assignments, this date is set when a
new action item is created and added to the set of action items.) When the state of an Action Item changes, a red warning is displayed at the bottom of the Action Item screen informing the user that the Action Item has been altered but not yet been saved.
Pressing the “Update” button will save the date and reset the warning. Should the user direct Della to another screen while the warning is shown, another warning dialog pops up telling the user that proceeding with these unsaved changes to the action item will result in the loss of the
data. It then gives the user a choice of continuing to the new screen or returning to update the action item.
